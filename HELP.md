# Assignment Solution

## Overview

This project represents my solution to the assignment provided. The primary focus was on selecting the appropriate algorithm and data structures to solve the problem effectively. While the assignment mentioned that the code does **not need to run or even compile**, I decided to go beyond the minimum requirements and implement a working solution.

## Approach

### Algorithm and Data Structure Choice
The main task was to devise a solution using an efficient algorithm and suitable data structures. I completed this part within the 2-hour limit set by the assignment. However, I invested additional time (approximately 8 hours) to implement the algorithm into a functional project with tests.

### Code Implementation
The provided code is **not optimized** due to time constraints, as my primary focus was on showcasing how the algorithm and data structure work in practice rather than refining the solution. With additional time, there are clear opportunities for optimization.

### Tests
To demonstrate the functionality of the code, I added some tests. These tests are designed to show how the algorithm processes the data and handles specific scenarios. However, they do not cover all possible edge cases.

### Guides
- **Test Execution**: Tests have to be run as a whole class and not separately because their meaning and functionality depend on the sequence in which they are executed. Running the entire class ensures that the shared state across tests behaves as expected.
- **Readability**: The tests are easy to read, and there is nothing unexpected or overly complicated in their logic.
- **Coverage**: I tried to simulate different situations and wrote tests for various scenarios, although I couldn't cover all possible cases.

## Acknowledgment of Limitations
- I did not spend more than 2 hours on the data structure or algorithm, as per the assignment guidelines.
- For creating the project, including writing code and tests, I spent around 8 hours.
- My solution is not the best and can definitely be improved. Since the focus was on delivering a functional solution within a limited timeframe and without significant external help, some flaws are to be expected.

## Personal Note
I enjoyed working on this challenge and found it stimulating. To clarify:
- Aside from addressing technical questions, I did not use Google or ChatGPT to generate the solution.
- My decision to spend additional time on the project reflects my enthusiasm for delivering a working solution and my ability to bring theoretical concepts to life.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
